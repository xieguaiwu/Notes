As a former professor in the University, a profession often connectedwith wisdom and education, Rita Dove was aware that all of her audiencesand herself share a common affiliation. This realization has influencedher choice of method to organize her speech, in which she established anethos. Furthermore, the specific language and tone she used werecarefully adapted to the occasion of commencement, which is consideredas a event for the elder and honorable members of the society to giveadvice to the ones who are about to enter the adult world. However, as awriter, Dove chose to break the normal custom of such occasions bytransforming this conventional ceremony into an uncommon guidance toface the capriciousness in adult life, which is composed of personalanecdotes, metaphorical language, and sincere encouragement. Eventually,the pathos was included in order to aim her purpose.

Firstly, she funnily introduced the role of a commencement speaker byusing unformal phrases such as "googled it," which setted up a tone ofpersonal guidance, rather than a constrained formal enlightenment.Subsequently, she taught the students be "hungry," another example forthe strategic usage of untraditional expression, which urged thegraduates to feel unsatisfied in their future lives. In order toelaborate the meaning of this intellecutual hunger, the speakerintroduced a set of claims, gradually outlined the ideal image of a onewho does not waste time, does not get himself stuck in a biased mind,and always has the honesty and courage to follow his own interest, whoselife is foreverly passionable.

After talking about visionary ideals, Dove then laid out clear methodsto reach to those goals. Her second wish that "I which you hard work"clarifies the special way to achieve one's ambition: rather than"back-breaking labor," she encouraged students to work hard and preparecreatively, applying the instance of actress Lupita Nyong'o to act as afundamental support. In order to be pragmatic, she quotated words fromflautist James Galway, as an vivid evidence to support her claim thatencouraged the listeners to "always be 150% prepared." Her choice forthis certain artist reflected her profession also as an artist, thusinhenced the affinity between the quatation and her statement.Additionally, she also linked the development of her career to heradvice. She did not avoid to depict her imperfect start as a shy kid inhigh school, but also stated her consistency of being extremelywell-prepared, from being awarded the Pulitzer Prize to reading poetryin front of the president. As a matter of fact, the mention of herpersonal achievements during this part of the speech also improved thereliability in her argument.

Finally, as the commencement was coming to an end, Dove gave her lastadvice to the listeners - "I wish you uncertainty." This part of claimcould be regarded as the expansion of the first part. It compared theshift possibility and the solidity of facts in life to stones in aflowing stream, literarily carried out the majority of changes andopportunities in life. Henceforward, she argued the importance for oneto seek for more, rather than stay in a comfort zone: "You cannot waitfor revelation to come down upon you in a cloud of gossamer and angelicsighs; more often than not you have to seek it out." At this point, Dovehad returned to her first advice for "stay hungry," representing thecompleteness in the structure of her speech.

Throughout the address, Dove's rhetorical choices were the most suitablefor her rhetorical situation. As an authoritative professor, sheleveraged her ethos to speak with affection. Her lyrical language fitsthe intention of her audiences - that was about to graduate from theschool - to seek life experience and pratical wisdom. She delivered herwishes in a mixture of stories, famous examples and interest-orientedvalues, constructing an overall ideal image for the graduates. Inconclusion, by sewing together metaphor, anecdote, and repetition, RitaDove effectively conveys her wishes for hunger, hard work, anduncertainty, leaving her audience with a resonant call to embrace life's complexities with curiosity, diligence, and courage.
