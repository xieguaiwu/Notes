> If the price elasticity of supply is 1.5, and a price increase led to a 1.8% increase in quantity supplied, then the price increase is about

Price Elasticity of Supply ($\text{PES}$):

$$\text{PES} = \frac{\%\ \text{Change in Quantity Supplied}}{\%\ \text{Change in Price}}$$

To find the percentage change in price, we rearrange the formula:

$$\%\ \text{Change in Price} = \frac{\%\ \text{Change in Quantity Supplied}}{\text{PES}}$$

Plugging in the given values:

  * $\text{PES} = 1.5$
  * $\%\ \text{Change in Quantity Supplied} = 1.8\%$

$$\%\ \text{Change in Price} = \frac{1.8\%}{1.5} = 1.2\%$$
