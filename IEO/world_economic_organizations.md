### 🏛️ World Trade Organization (WTO)

The WTO is the sole global international organization dealing with the rules of trade between nations.

*   **History & Purpose**: Established in 1995, it succeeded the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Its fundamental goals are to ensure that trade flows as smoothly, predictably, and freely as possible. It aims to raise living standards, ensure full employment, and foster sustainable development.
*   **Core Functions**:
    1.  **Administering Trade Agreements**: It serves as a framework for implementing and administering multilateral and plurilateral trade agreements.
    2.  **Providing a Forum for Trade Negotiations**: It is a platform for members to negotiate the reduction of trade barriers.
    3.  **Settling Trade Disputes**: Its binding dispute settlement mechanism is a cornerstone of the global trading system, allowing members to resolve conflicts according to agreed rules.
    4.  **Reviewing National Trade Policies**: Through the Trade Policy Review Mechanism (TPRM), it monitors members' trade policies to ensure transparency and adherence to rules.
*   **Structure**:
    *   **Ministerial Conference**: The highest decision-making body, meeting at least once every two years.
    *   **General Council**: Composed of ambassadors and delegates from all members, it meets regularly in Geneva to carry out the day-to-day work. It also convenes as the **Dispute Settlement Body (DSB)** and the **Trade Policy Review Body (TPRB)**.
    *   **Subsidiary Bodies**: The General Council delegates work to three major councils (Goods, Services, and Intellectual Property) and numerous specialized committees and working groups.
    *   **Secretariat**: Headed by the **Director-General** (currently Dr. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala), it provides administrative and technical support and has no independent decision-making power.

### 💰 International Monetary Fund (IMF)

The IMF is a cooperative institution aimed at stabilizing the international monetary system.

*   **History & Purpose**: Created in 1944 at the Bretton Woods conference, it began operations in 1947. Its primary mission is to ensure the stability of the international monetary system—the system of exchange rates and international payments that enables countries to transact with each other.
*   **Core Functions**:
    1.  **Surveillance**: It monitors the economic and financial policies of its member countries and the global economy, providing policy advice.
    2.  **Financial Assistance**: It provides temporary financing to member countries experiencing balance of payments problems, helping them stabilize their economies.
    3.  **Capacity Development**: It offers technical assistance and training to help countries build stronger economic institutions and manage their economies more effectively.
*   **Structure**:
    *   **Board of Governors**: The highest authority, consisting of one governor and one alternate governor from each member country (usually the finance minister or central bank governor). It meets annually.
    *   **Executive Board**: A 24-member board responsible for the Fund's daily operations. It is chaired by the **Managing Director** (currently Kristalina Georgieva).
    *   **Voting Power**: Unlike the UN, the IMF uses a weighted voting system based on a member's **"quota."** A country's quota, determined by its economic size, influences its financial contribution, voting power, and access to financing. This system has been a point of discussion to better reflect shifts in the global economy.

### 🏦 World Bank Group

The World Bank Group is a family of five institutions that provide financing and knowledge to help developing countries reduce poverty and promote sustainable development.

*   **History & Purpose**: Also born out of the 1944 Bretton Woods conference, its initial mission was the post-war reconstruction of Europe. Today, its twin goals are to end extreme poverty and boost shared prosperity.
*   **Constituent Institutions & Their Roles**:
    1.  **International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD)**: Lends to creditworthy middle-income governments.
    2.  **International Development Association (IDA)**: Provides interest-free loans and grants (credits) to the world's poorest countries. IBRD and IDA together are often referred to as the "World Bank."
    3.  **International Finance Corporation (IFC)**: Focuses on the private sector, providing investment, advisory services, and mobilizing capital in developing countries.
    4.  **Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA)**: Promotes foreign direct investment into developing countries by offering political risk insurance (guarantees) to investors and lenders.
    5.  **International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID)**: Provides facilities for the conciliation and arbitration of investment disputes between foreign investors and host states.
*   **Structure**:
    *   **Board of Governors**: The supreme body, with one governor per member country, meeting annually.
    *   **Executive Directors**: A 25-member board that conducts the day-to-day business at the Bank's headquarters.
    *   **President**: The World Bank President (traditionally nominated by the United States) is the presiding officer and chief of the operational staff.

### 📈 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)

The OECD is not a financial institution but a unique forum and knowledge-based organization where governments work together to address economic and social challenges.

*   **History & Purpose**: Established in 1961, succeeding the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation (OEEC) which administered the Marshall Plan. Its mission is to promote policies designed to achieve the highest sustainable economic growth, employment, and rising standards of living while maintaining financial stability.
*   **Core Functions**:
    1.  **Data Collection & Analysis**: It is one of the world's largest and most reliable sources of comparable statistical, economic, and social data.
    2.  **Policy Analysis & Recommendations**: It conducts in-depth reviews of members' policies and provides peer-based recommendations.
    3.  **Setting International Standards**: It develops and promotes international legal instruments and "soft law" standards in areas such as **taxation** (e.g., the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting project), corporate governance, and chemical safety.
*   **Structure**:
    *   **The Council**: The supreme decision-making body, composed of ambassadors from all members and the European Union. It is chaired by the Secretary-General and provides strategic direction. Decisions are made by consensus.
    *   **The Committees**: The core of the OECD's work. More than 300 specialized committees, with experts from member countries, develop ideas, review policies, and draft standards.
    *   **The Secretariat**: Led by the **Secretary-General**, it comprises over 3,500 staff who serve the committees and conduct research. This structure allows the OECD to function as a "global standards laboratory."
